# DataCo-SMART-SUPPLY-CHAIN-FOR-DATA-ANALYSIS
E-commerce goods Late delivery risk identification by predicting fastest and normal Shipping Durations. The Decision Tree model built by us, will enable E-commerce and Goods/products delivery industries to identify the 'risk of late delivery' and predict the fastest and normal duration of goods shipment for their Inland and foreign clients/ customers/buyers.

GOAL :
Building a Multi-Output Decision Tree Regressor to determine the maximum range of shipping time, by predicting the Fastest and Normal duration for shipping of goods for both Inland and International customers.
Building a Binary Classifier to classify orders with high probabilty of late delivery (Late Delivery Risk analyser).
